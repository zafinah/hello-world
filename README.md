# hello-world

I'm interested in a wide variety of subject including behavioral economics, positive psychology, coaching, stories and how they are told in different mediums, games including board, role playing, card and computer games, metrics and metric selection, business process specifically quality assurance processes, and pretty much anything else that catches my fancy.
